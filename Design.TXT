What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following properties were added to the model:
  1) In the Game model, I have added property for keeping track of game history.
  2) Added the past_guesses property in the Game model in order to compare new user guesses against
     the past guesses he/she made.
  3) In the Score model, I have added property for points and remaining guesses calculations.
  4) Added a History model, in order to record the past guesses that the user made per game.
  5) Added a total_score property to the user model in order to use it when ranking
    the players from highest total score to the lowest
  6) Added the word_state property to the Game object in order to reveal the solution
    gradual given the users guesses.
  

What were some of the trade - offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostly the struggle in building the backend was the inability to visualize the
front - end application of the endpoints.  Mostly one would have to imagine how
these end points would be called and used in from a front end application.
