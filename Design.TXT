What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following properties were added to the model:
  1) In the Game model, I have added property for keeping track of game history.
  2) In the Score model, I have added property for points and remaining guesses calculations.
  3) the user model was not updated.

What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostly the struggle in building the backend was the inability to visual the
front-end application of the endpoints.  Mostly one would have to imagine how
these end points would be called and used in from a front end application.
